# Requirements

# Introduction
 This is a project to make all the basic calculations ike addition, subtraction, multiplication and division using C program. A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. It is done by using 4* 4 Keypad, 16*2 LCD with the help of ATmega328 microcontroller.
 
 # Components
 1. 4*4 Keypad
 2. 16*2 LCD
 3. ATmega328

# Objective
The main objective of this project is to make all the basic calculations in response to the supplied input instantly with a calculator.

#Features

1.Addition of different numbers
2.Subtraction of different numbers
3.Multiplication of different numbers
4.Division of different numbers

# 4Ws and 1Hs

# Why:
1. It is easy to do and saves a lot of time
2. It gives the exact answer as there won't be any error in calculation

# Where:
1. It can be used in places like shops, offices, etc.,
 
# Who:
1. This function can be performed by anyone like students, office employees, retail shop owners etc., 
2. It can also be used for personal purposes

# When:
1. It can be used daily or whenever there is
a need for calculation

# How:
1. The user can carry the calculator handy with him by a device or use it through integrations with phone or laptop.
 

# SWOT Analysis:

# Strengths:
1. It is not time consuming as human brain's calculation and the results are accurate

# Weakness:
1. Humans might forget the art of calculating instantly.
2. It makes humans lazy.

# Opportunity:

1. This application can be integrated with phone or laptop.

# Threats:
1. Human brains become dependent on this.
